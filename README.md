# Traffic Light Optimisation with Emergency Vehicle Detection

## Overview

This project enhances urban traffic management by optimizing traffic light control systems to prioritize emergency vehicles. By integrating real-time siren detection, the system ensures that emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, police cars) receive timely green lights, reducing response times and improving overall traffic flow.

## Features

- **Emergency Vehicle Detection**: Detects the presence of emergency vehicles via siren sound recognition.
- **Dynamic Traffic Light Control**: Adjusts traffic signals in real-time to prioritize emergency vehicles.
- **Modular Design**: Supports both single and double intersection management.
- **Simulation Environment**: Provides simulation tools to validate the system under different traffic conditions.
